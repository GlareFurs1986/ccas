Hi, thank you for your interest in contributing to the WordPress Coding Standards! We look forward to working with you.

# Reporting Bugs

Please search the repo to see if your issue has been reported already and if so, comment in that issue instead of opening a new one.

Before reporting a bug, you should check what sniff an error is coming from.
Running `phpcs` with the `-s` flag will show the name of the sniff with each error.

Bug reports containing a minimal code sample which can be used to reproduce the issue are highly appreciated as those are most easily actionable.

## Upstream Issues

Since WPCS employs many sniffs that are part of PHPCS, sometimes an issue will be caused by a bug in PHPCS and not in WPCS itself. If the error message in question doesn't come from a sniff whose name starts with `WordPress`, the issue is probably a bug in PHPCS itself, and should be [reported there](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues).

# Contributing patches and new features

## Branches

Ongoing development will be done in the `develop` branch with merges done into `master` once considered stable.

To contribute an improvement to this project, fork the repo and open a pull request to the `develop` branch. Alternatively, if you have push access to this repo, create a feature branch prefixed by `feature/` and then open an intra-repo PR from that branch to `develop`.

Once a commit is made to `develop`, a PR should be opened from `develop` into `master` and named "Next release". This PR will provide collaborators with a forum to discuss the upcoming stable release.

# Considerations when writing sniffs

## Public properties

When writing sniffs, always remember that any `public` sniff property can be overruled via a custom ruleset by the end-user.
Only make a property `public` if that is the intended behaviour.

When you introduce new `public` sniff properties, or your sniff extends a class from which you inherit a `public` property, please don't forget to update the [public properties wiki page](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/wiki/Customizable-sniff-properties) with the relevant details once your PR has been merged into the `develop` branch.

## Whitelist comments

> **Important**:
> PHPCS 3.2.0 introduced new selective ignore annotations, which can be considered an improved version of the whitelist mechanism which WPCS contains.
>
> Support for the WPCS native whitelist comments has been deprecated in WPCS 2.0.0 and will be removed in WPCS 3.0.0.
>
> With that in mind, (new) sniffs should not introduce new WPCS native whitelist comments.


# Unit Testing

## Pre-requisites
* WordPress-Coding-Standards
* PHP_CodeSniffer 3.3.1 or higher
* PHPUnit 4.x, 5.x, 6.x or 7.x

The WordPress Coding Standards use the `PHP_CodeSniffer` native unit test suite for unit testing the sniffs.

Presuming you have installed `PHP_CodeSniffer` and the WordPress-Coding-Standards as [noted in the README](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards#how-to-use-this), all you need now is `PHPUnit`.

> N.B.: If you installed WPCS using Composer, make sure you used `--prefer-source` or run `composer install --prefer-source` now to make sure the unit tests are available.
> Other than that, you're all set already as Composer will have installed PHPUnit for you.

If you already have PHPUnit installed on your system: Congrats, you're all set.

## Installing PHPUnit

N.B.: _If you used Composer to install the WordPress Coding Standards, you can skip this step._

You can either navigate to the directory where the `PHP_CodeSniffer` repo is checked out and do `composer install` to install the `dev` dependencies or you can [install PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/7.4/installation.html) as a PHAR file.

You may want to add the directory where PHPUnit is installed to a `PATH` environment variable for your operating system to make the command available everywhere on your system.

## Before running the unit tests

N.B.: _If you used Composer to install the WordPress Coding Standards, you can skip this step._

For the unit tests to work, you need to make sure PHPUnit can find your `PHP_CodeSniffer` install.

The easiest way to do this is to add a `phpunit.xml` file to the root of your WPCS installation and set a `PHPCS_DIR` environment variable from within this file.
Copy the existing `phpunit.xml.dist` file and add the below `<env>` directive within the `<php>` section. Make sure to adjust the path to reflect your local setup.
```xml
	<php>
		<env name="PHPCS_DIR" value="/path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/"/>
	</php>
```

## Running the unit tests

* If you didn't install WPCS using Composer, make sure you have registered the directory in which you installed WPCS with PHPCS using:
    ```sh
    phpcs --config-set installed_paths path/to/WPCS
    ```
* Navigate to the directory in which you installed WPCS.
* To run the unit tests:
    ```sh
    phpunit --filter WordPress --bootstrap="/path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/tests/bootstrap.php" /path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/tests/AllTests.php

    # Or if you've installed WPCS with Composer:
    composer run-tests
    ```

Expected output:
```
PHPUnit 7.5.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

Runtime:       PHP 7.2.13
Configuration: /WordPressCS/phpunit.xml

## Unit Testing conventions

If you look inside the `WordPress/Tests` subdirectory, you'll see the structure mimics the `WordPress/Sniffs` subdirectory structure. For example, the `WordPress/Sniffs/PHP/POSIXFunctionsSniff.php` sniff has its unit test class defined in `WordPress/Tests/PHP/POSIXFunctionsUnitTest.php` which checks the `WordPress/Tests/PHP/POSIXFunctionsUnitTest.inc` test case file. See the file naming convention?

Lets take a look at what's inside `POSIXFunctionsUnitTest.php`:

```php
...
namespace WordPressCS\WordPress\Tests\PHP;

use PHP_CodeSniffer\Tests\Standards\AbstractSniffUnitTest;

class POSIXFunctionsUnitTest extends AbstractSniffUnitTest {

	/**
	 * Returns the lines where errors should occur.
	 *
	 * @return array <int line number> => <int number of errors>
	 */
	public function getErrorList() {
		return array(
			13 => 1,
			16 => 1,
			18 => 1,
			20 => 1,
			22 => 1,
			24 => 1,
			26 => 1,
		);

	}
...
```

Also note the class name convention. The method `getErrorList()` MUST return an array of line numbers indicating errors (when running `phpcs`) found in `WordPress/Tests/PHP/POSIXFunctionsUnitTest.inc`.
If you run:

```sh
$ cd /path-to-cloned/phpcs
$ ./bin/phpcs --standard=Wordpress -s /path/to/WordPress/Tests/PHP/POSIXFunctionsUnitTest.inc --sniffs=WordPress.PHP.POSIXFunctions
...

You'll see the line number and number of ERRORs we need to return in the `getErrorList()` method.

The `--sniffs=...` directive limits the output to the sniff you are testing.

## Code Standards for this project

The sniffs and test files - not test _case_ files! - for WPCS should be written such that they pass the `WordPress-Extra` and the `WordPress-Docs` code standards using the custom ruleset as found in `/.phpcs.xml.dist`.
